We don't say "I love you" but that's fine by me

00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,090
Always at your crib, you live right by me

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,300
Never met your parents

32
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,900
They don't know about us

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,400
Fancy ass dinners

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,720

Ooh-la-la

43
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,700
