1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,060
In my room, I hear you call my name

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,430
Your perfume inside my pillowcase

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,830
I feel you and your fingers trace

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,720
But I know you haven't been here in days

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,430
I have a video that I watch in my bed

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,150
It replays in my head

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,300
You say you love me, We, we lay together every night

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,620
You touch me, I, I, I'm losin' track of time

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,380
You kiss me, I, I, I look into your eyes

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,900
But it's only in my mind

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,140
But it's only in my mind

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,560
But it's only in my mind

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,180
But it's only in my mind

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,340
But it's only in my mind

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,300
Honestly, I only think of you, see your face

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,640
Alone in a crowded room, hallucinate

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,980
That is the one where you lay, but I know

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,750
You haven't been here in days

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,320
I have a video that I watch in my bed

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,160
It replays in my head

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,240
You say you love me, We, we lay together every night

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,680
You touch me, I, I, I'm losin' track of time

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,410
You kiss me, I, I, I look into your eyes

24
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,740
But it's only in my mind

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,170
But it's only in my mind

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,430
But it's only in my mind

27
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,880
But it's only in my mind

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,170
But it's only in my mind

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,680
But it's only in my mind

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,100
But it's only in my mind

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,470
You say you love me, We, we lay together every night

32
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,900
You touch me, I, I, I'm losing track of time

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,670
You kiss me, I, I, I look into your eyes

34
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,080
But it's only in my mind

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,520
But it's only in my mind

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,860
But it's only in my mind

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,330
But it's only in my mind

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,600
But it's only in my mind

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,150
But it's only in my mind

40
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,297
But it's only in my mind
