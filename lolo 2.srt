We don't say "I love you" but that's fine by me

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,090
Always at your crib, you live right by me

Got me watching Shark Tank, we're so creative

You don't say much

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,540
Never met your parents

32
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,900
They don't know about us

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,170
Fancy ass dinners, overrated

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,790
