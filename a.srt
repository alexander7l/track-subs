We don't say "I love you" but that's fine by me

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,093
Always at your crib, you live right by me

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,440
Got me watching Shark Tank, we're so creative

You don't take me on dates, but I don't hate it

You don't say much

32
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,537
Never met your parents

33
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:52,897
They don't know about us

34
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,170
Fancy ass dinners, overrated

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,791
